# Chaos Stream Proxy Configurator

The **Chaos Stream Proxy Configurator** is a tool that helps you modify HLS streams by introducing custom delays to specific segments or all segments of the stream. Itâ€™s designed to work with a chaos-proxy that manipulates the stream based on the URL parameters you generate.

## How It Works

The app allows you to:
- Input the base URL of your chaos-proxy.
- Input the URL of your HLS stream.
- Specify the delay (in milliseconds) to apply to stream segments.
- Define which segments will receive the delay or apply it to all segments.

Once you provide these inputs, the app generates a URL that can be used to modify the behavior of the HLS stream as it passes through the chaos-proxy.
